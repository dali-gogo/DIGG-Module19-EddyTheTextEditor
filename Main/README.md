Dalia Gomez - Module 19 Challenge: Eddy The Text Editor

## Description
The purpose of this challenge was to build a text editor that runs in the browser, being a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria; it was intended to use redundancy and is able to function offline. An existing application was used as starting point, and it was improved by implementing methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database.
